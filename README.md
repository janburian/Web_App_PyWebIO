# Web_App_PyWebIO
## Description
The main goal of this computer vision application is to detect cell nuclei in microscopic histological images. 
It is based on Detectron2 framework, so for the detection it uses deep neural network. User also can train his own model through this application, too.

The application was written in Python and it is powered by PyWebIO module.

## How the app works

* Step 1: 
* Step 2: 


## Installation of important modules to run the app
* scaffan (installation steps: https://github.com/mjirik/scaffan/blob/master/README.md)
* detectron2 (installation steps: https://github.com/mjirik/tutorials/blob/main/detectron_windows/readme.md)
* PyWebIO (pip3 install -U pywebio)

All of these modules need to be installed in the same Python environment.
